# <Find Your Forever Friend>

## Description

We wanted to make this app to make pet finding simple and easy. One click of a button and you will have a list specific to find what you are looking for.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This website is designed using Tailwind CSS, Bulma IO, and Petfinder API to help you find your next pet. You are able to choose whatt ype of animal you want and the zip code you are looking for and results will match your request. We made it possible for you to find your best friend in one easy click!

User Story:
AS A pet-lover with a specific taste
I WANT to search for my best friend
SO THAT I can be matched properly

GIVEN Iâ€™m on the landing page WHEN I enter my zip code and pet type THEN I see a list of pets nearby that I can select in order to view details AND map of animals's locations.

The landing page looks like below
